    ## Python Files

    [myfunctions.py]
    --------------------------
    Contains functions that describing SIRD dynamic and that are commonly used functionalities in other notebooks. 


    [Optimal output.py]
    --------------------------
    Output the optimal machenism results with differenct enviromental parameters.
    We perform self-coded grid search to find the solution.



    ## Notebook Files

    [GRBT output.ipynb]
    --------------------------
    Output the GRBT machenism results with differenct enviromental parameters


    [PureStrategy GRBT.ipynb]
    --------------------------
    Determine types of GRBT equlibrium at each level of initial mask coverage


    [PureStrategy GRBT_growth.ipynb]
    --------------------------
    Determine types of GRBT equlibrium at each level of initial mask coverage.
    The mask production growth.
