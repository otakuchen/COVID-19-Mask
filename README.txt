    ## Python Files

    [myfunctions.py]
    --------------------------
    Contains functions that describing SIRD dynamic and that are commonly used functionalities in other notebooks. 


    [Optimal output.py]
    --------------------------
    Output the optimal machenism results with differenct enviromental parameters.
    We perform self-coded grid search to find the solution.
